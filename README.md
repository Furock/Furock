Repository: https://github.com/Furock/AutoClicker
  
**ðŸ§° Technologies**
---
Java, swing for ui, Gradle, vscode
	
**ðŸŽ¯ Motivation**  
I liked clicker games and there this automation makes sense. Besides a friend of mine complained, that her downloaded autoclicker is not good enough
    
**ðŸ“œ Explanation**
It has a minimal UI (photo is coming), and it's more for technical users than non-technical users:
You can set the time between pressing the click button and releasing it and the waited time between two clicks. 
The Background: Everyone has different hardware and it's difficult to guarantee x clicks per second. Instead you can control finer settings and also use an integrated test how many clicks per seconds there are 
  
**ðŸš€ Further Potential**
* better UI
* using C/C++ for better performance
* make clicks/s settable
* ...
