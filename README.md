## Project Details
<details> 
<summary>AutoClicker | finished</summary>
  
### Motivation

I liked clicker games and there this automation makes sense. Besides a friend of mine was unsatisfied with her downloaded autoclicker.
    
### About the program

It has a minimal UI (photo is coming soon), and it's more for technical users than non-technical users:
You can set the time between pressing the click button and releasing it and the time waited between two clicks. 
The Background: Everyone has different hardware and it's difficult to guarantee x clicks per second. Instead you can control finer settings and also use an integrated test how many clicks per seconds there are 
  
### Further Potential

* better UI
* using C/C++ for better performance
* make clicks/s settable

<summary>FileServer</summary>

### Motivation

I had files on several devices in the same network and wanted to gather them on one device, without them needing to leave the private local network and without USB sticks or bluetooth.

### About the program

(photo is coming soon)

### Further Potential

* creating folders on the server
* deleting files on the server
