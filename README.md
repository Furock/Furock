		<summary>AutoClicker</summary>
		Repository: https://github.com/Furock/AutoClicker
		  
		**ðŸ§° Technologies**    
		Java, swing for ui, Gradle, vscode
			
		**ðŸŽ¯ Motivation**  
		I liked clicker games and there this automation makes sense. Besides a friend of mine complained, that her downloaded autoclicker is not good enough
		    
		**ðŸ“œ Explanation**
		It has a minimal UI (photo is coming), and it's more for technical users than non-technical users:
		You can set the time between pressing the click button and releasing it and the waited time between two clicks. 
		The Background: Everyone has different hardware and it's difficult to guarantee x clicks per second. Instead you can control finer settings and also use an integrated test how many clicks per seconds there are 
		  
		**ðŸš€ Further Potential**
		* better UI
		* using C/C++ for better performance
		* make clicks/s settable
		* ...
